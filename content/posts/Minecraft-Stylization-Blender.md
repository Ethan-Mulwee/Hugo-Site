# Introduction
When I create stylized Minecraft artwork my workflow is almost entirely within Blender. This way of working allows for a lot of flexiblity as the scene and shading can be worked on simultaneously. And since much of the shading can be done procedually it also adapts very well to animation. There are many ways to do it so I'm going to cover the basic theory that encompases the idea. And then the past present and future of my workflow.

Note: this workflow does not to automate the artistic process. It can provide decent default results that can be easily tweaked by a technically minded artist.

# Overview
This is a relatively software agnostic overview of how to go about creating stylized shading

## Highlights
Highlights can be split into two different maps a edge map and a light map which makes it much easier to work with. 

{{% columns ratio="2:1" %}}
### Edge Map
The Edge Map serves as a mask determining where highlights can and cannot go
